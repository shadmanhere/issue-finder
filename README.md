## Contribute to Issue Finder

### Pre-requisites

- Code Editor, e.g. VS Code
- Git and a GitHub account

### Getting Started

Getting a local copy of Issue Finder up and running is easy with these following steps.

### Clone the repository

In your terminal, navigate to the directory you would like to store the project and run the git-command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/voscarmv/issue-finder.git
```

After the git-command navigate into the project folder using `cd`:

```bash
cd issue-finder
```

Now you can open the project in your favorite code editor.

> [!NOTE]
> For VS Code you can use the command `code .` to quickly open projects in the editor. 

### Install dependencies

After you have cloned the project and have navigated into the project. You 
need to install the required dependencies using `npm`, or your perferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure your environment

You will also need to create a `.env` file to later store your GitHub access token in.

> [!NOTE]
> The access token is needed for the app to make API calls to GitHub.

```bash
touch .env
```

With the `.env` file created, you can generate an access token [in your settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and add that access token to the `REACT_APP_API_KEY` variable.

```bash
echo REACT_APP_API_KEY=ghp_my_github_token > .env
```

Your token will start with either `ghp_` or `github_pat_`, depending on if you generated a classic token or a fine-tuned token. Both will work for this application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The GitHub access token doesn't need any scopes to function.

### Run the application

Now that the dependencies are installed and your environment is setup. You can run the application using `npm` or your perferred package manager:

```bash
npm start
```

### Linter Setup

- Run `npx eslint .` which will print any errors found.
- Run `npx eslint . --fix` to automatically fix the errors.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
